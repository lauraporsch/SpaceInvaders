# SpaceInvaders
My own version of the famous Space Invaders game, using the turtle module

Currently working on it!

## What I learned / used for the first time:
- use any()- function to iterate through a list and see if any item satisfies a condition (used to detect when aliens at the edge hit the screen, so all aliens change direction immediately)
- use random module to randomise gameplay

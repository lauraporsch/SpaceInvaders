# SpaceInvaders
My own version of the famous Space Invaders game, using the turtle module.

The challenge was building the main functions of the game with the turtles module.
As the options are restricted in this module, I used workaround that still give the same gameplay experience.


## What I learned / used for the first time:
- use any()- function to iterate through a list and see if any item satisfies a condition (used to detect when aliens at the edge hit the screen, so all aliens change direction immediately)
- use random module to randomise gameplay (Mystery Alien, Alien-Shooter)
- how to have two Turtles with different attributes moving together and dependant on each other (Player and Shooter, Aliens and Shooter)
- finding and fixing bugs in games that can have different outcomes
